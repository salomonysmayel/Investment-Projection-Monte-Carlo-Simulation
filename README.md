Expected cumulative returns at 30 years for the 10th percentile 1.6377228612969736
Expected cumulative returns at 30 years for the 50th percentile 3.7765701646226226
Expected cumulative returns at 30 years for the 90th percentile 6.88829773148299

Expected portfolio return at the 10th, initial investment of $20,000 is =  $52754.45722593948
Expected portfolio return at the 50th, initial investment of $20,000 is =  $95531.40329245245
Expected portfolio return at the 90th, initial investment of $20,000 is =  $157765.9546296598

With 4% withdraw rate from the retirement portfolio, projected retirement annual income  $1913.6860494840018, which is bigger than projected year income of $6085  

A 50% increase in the initial investment would generate a projected retirement annual income of $2870.529074226003. Which is bigger than the projected $1913.6860494840018
